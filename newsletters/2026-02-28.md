# 🤖 AI & GitHub Agent News – February 28, 2026

# Today’s Highlights

GitHub doubled down on operationalizing AI-assisted development: Copilot usage metrics are now generally available, and enterprise metrics have expanded to include Copilot CLI telemetry. Alongside this, a practical guide shows how to move from idea to pull request using the Copilot CLI. The common thread is visibility and repeatability—making agent-driven workflows measurable and easier to adopt across teams.

## GitHub & Copilot

- [From idea to pull request: A practical guide to building with GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/from-idea-to-pull-request-a-practical-guide-to-building-with-github-copilot-cli/)
  - Why it matters: A hands-on path from intent to reviewable changes helps teams turn Copilot from a novelty into a standardized, repeatable workflow. For AI agent developers, this is a template for structuring agent-in-the-loop coding so outputs land cleanly in version control and review processes. Watch for actionable patterns that reduce friction between prompting, code generation, and pull request creation.

  - Why it matters: Enterprise leaders can now quantify how the Copilot CLI is actually used, not just IDE chat or completion activity. This visibility is crucial for governance, ROI assessment, and identifying where agentic tooling is gaining traction. Watch for org-wide comparisons of CLI versus editor workflows to inform enablement and policy.

  - Why it matters: GA signals production readiness for unified Copilot usage reporting, giving teams a single place to monitor adoption and impact. For agent developers, consistent metrics enable A/B testing of workflows and data-driven rollout strategies. Watch for standardization of KPIs that link usage to code review throughput and developer satisfaction.

## Key Takeaways

- Copilot metrics are now GA, making usage tracking a first-class, production-ready capability.
- Enterprise metrics expanded to include Copilot CLI telemetry, improving visibility into agentic, command-line workflows.
- Practical guidance on going from idea to PR with Copilot CLI can help standardize agent-in-the-loop development.
- Better measurement enables governance, ROI analysis, and targeted enablement for AI-assisted coding.
- Expect teams to compare CLI and IDE Copilot usage to optimize workflows and policies.
