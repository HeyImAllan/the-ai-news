# 🤖 AI & GitHub Agent News – February 27, 2026

# AI Dev Tools Daily — February 27, 2026

## Today’s Highlights
GitHub is doubling down on Copilot as a controllable, enterprise-ready coding agent: new governance features, model choice, security scanning, and mobile notifications aim to make agents safer and easier to operate in production. Beyond GitHub, OpenAI introduced a domain benchmark with a federal lab, and DeepMind announced a faster image model—signals that evaluation and speed are becoming central to real-world agent workflows.

## GitHub & Copilot

- [What’s new with GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/whats-new-with-github-copilot-coding-agent/)
  - Adds a model picker, self-review, and built-in security scanning. For agent developers, this points to a shift from “assistive autocomplete” toward autonomous coding tasks with guardrails. Watch how model selection, automated review, and security checks affect reliability and time-to-merge.

- [Enterprise AI Controls & agent control plane now generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-26-enterprise-ai-controls-agent-control-plane-now-generally-available)
  - GA of centralized controls and an agent control plane makes enterprise governance and operations first-class. If you deploy agents across teams, this is a step toward policy enforcement, standard configurations, and operational visibility at scale.

- [Claude and Codex now available for Copilot Business & Pro users](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-26-claude-and-codex-now-available-for-copilot-business-pro-users)
  - Expanded model options let teams pick the engine that best fits their codebase and tasks. This matters for latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs—evaluate task performance across models before standardizing.

- [Copilot Content Exclusion REST API in public preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-26-copilot-content-exclusion-rest-api-in-public-preview)
  - Admins can programmatically manage what content Copilot can access. This enables “policy-as-code” for data governance—useful for keeping sensitive repos or files out of agent context.

- [GitHub Mobile: Track coding agent progress in real time with Live Notifications](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-26-github-mobile-track-coding-agent-progress-in-real-time-with-live-notifications)
  - Real-time mobile notifications help devs and managers monitor long-running agent tasks away from the desktop. Expect better responsiveness to stuck jobs and faster iteration loops.

- [Copilot metrics report URLs update](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-26-copilot-metrics-report-urls-update)
  - Report download URLs from the usage metrics API now come from a new endpoint. If you automate reporting or billing, update your clients and watch for deprecation timelines to avoid breaks.

## Research & Benchmarks

- [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and OpenAI partner to accelerate federal permitting](https://openai.com/index/pacific-northwest-national-laboratory)
  - Introduces DraftNEPABench, a benchmark for federal permitting workflows. For agent builders in regulated domains, this highlights the need for domain-specific evaluation frameworks and task-relevant metrics, not just generic model scores.

## Foundation Models & Multimodal

- [Nano Banana 2: Combining Pro capabilities with lightning-fast speed](https://deepmind.google/blog/nano-banana-2-combining-pro-capabilities-with-lightning-fast-speed/)
  - A new image generation model emphasizing speed, “advanced world knowledge,” and production-ready specs. Fast, capable generation can unlock agent use cases that synthesize visuals on the fly—consider where low latency visuals improve UX or automation.

## Key Takeaways

- Copilot is evolving into a governed, auditable coding agent with model choice, self-review, and security scanning.
- Enterprise controls and an agent control plane are now GA, signaling serious support for large-scale, policy-driven agent deployments.
- API surface is growing on both governance (content exclusion) and observability (metrics URL updates, mobile live notifications).
- Domain benchmarks like DraftNEPABench underscore the importance of task-specific evaluation for agents in regulated workflows.
- Faster, more capable image models broaden the canvas for multimodal agents where latency and production-readiness matter.
