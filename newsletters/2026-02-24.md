# 🤖 AI & GitHub Agent News – February 24, 2026

Daily AI Dev Tools Briefing — February 24, 2026

Today's Highlights
Agentic development is moving from demos to default workflows: GitHub introduced Agentic Workflows and broadened Copilot controls and telemetry, while Google’s Gemini 3.1 Pro and Deep Think push reasoning for complex tasks. OpenAI spotlighted evaluation and safety with a critique of SWE-bench Verified and new funding for independent alignment research, and Hugging Face doubled down on local and edge AI with llama.cpp/GGML and Jetson VLM deployments. Across the ecosystem, open source scale, security, and maintainer support are emerging as critical levers for sustainable agent adoption.

GitHub & Copilot: Models, Metrics, and Agentic Automation
- Automate repository tasks with GitHub Agentic Workflows (Technical Preview) — GitHub Blog/Changelog
  https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/
  Why it matters: Coding agents you can wire into repository automation bring “agents in the loop” directly to developer workflows. Watch how permissions, observability, and failure recovery are handled in the preview before building critical paths around it.

- Organization-level Copilot usage metrics dashboard (Public Preview) — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-20-organization-level-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard-available-in-public-preview
  Why it matters: Org-level telemetry makes it easier to track adoption and impact where work actually happens. Expect teams to tie these metrics to ROI and policy decisions for agent rollout.

- GitHub Copilot support in Zed (GA) — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-19-github-copilot-support-in-zed-generally-available
  Why it matters: First‑class support in a fast, modern editor lowers friction for day‑to‑day agent assistance. If your teams use Zed, this removes an integration blocker.

- Copilot coding agent model picker (Business & Enterprise) — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-19-model-picker-for-copilot-coding-agent-for-copilot-business-and-enterprise-users
  Why it matters: The asynchronous, autonomous Copilot coding agent now lets you choose models, enabling performance, cost, or compliance trade‑offs. Standardize which models are allowed for different tasks.

- Selected Anthropic and OpenAI models deprecated in Copilot — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-19-selected-anthropic-and-openai-models-are-now-deprecated
  Why it matters: Model availability changes can silently break pipelines and policies. Audit your defaults and migration paths to avoid surprises.

- Gemini 3.1 Pro in GitHub Copilot (Public Preview) — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-19-gemini-3-1-pro-is-now-in-public-preview-in-github-copilot
  Why it matters: Access to a new agentic coding model broadens your evaluation surface within Copilot. Run head‑to‑head trials on your codebases to see if it improves task completion for your scenarios.

Developer Workflow & Actions
- Let’s talk about GitHub Actions — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/lets-talk-about-github-actions/

- What 986 million code pushes say about the developer workflow in 2025 — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/what-986-million-code-pushes-say-about-the-developer-workflow-in-2025/
  Why it matters: Nearly a billion commits worth of data show that the way we ship code has changed. Use these trends to refine where agents can remove toil or accelerate gates.

- Automate your project with GitHub Models in Actions — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/automate-your-project-with-github-models-in-actions/
  Why it matters: Directly invoking GitHub Models from Actions makes it straightforward to embed AI steps in CI/CD. Start with low‑risk tasks like summarization or triage before promoting to release‑critical jobs.

- Hosted vs self‑hosted runners with GitHub Actions — GitHub Changelog
  https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/when-to-choose-github-hosted-runners-or-self-hosted-runners-with-github-actions/
  Why it matters: Picking the right runner model is foundational for reliable agent automations. Map runner choices to workflow needs and constraints before scaling usage.
