# 🤖 AI & GitHub Agent News – February 24, 2026

# Daily AI Dev Tools Brief — February 24, 2026

## Today's Highlights
Edge deployment of multimodal AI is moving from concept to practice. A new guide from Hugging Face focuses on running open-source vision-language models (VLMs) on NVIDIA Jetson, underscoring the push toward on-device reasoning for robotics, IoT, and privacy-preserving applications.

## Edge & Deployment

  Why it matters: Running VLMs on Jetson enables multimodal agents (vision + language) to operate directly on embedded hardware, reducing latency and dependency on cloud connectivity. For agent developers, this unlocks real-world use cases in robotics, smart cameras, and edge analytics, where responsiveness and privacy are crucial. Watch for practical guidance around model selection, resource constraints, and deployment workflows tailored to Jetson-class devices.

## Key Takeaways
- Edge-capable VLMs are becoming more accessible, enabling multimodal agents to run on embedded hardware like NVIDIA Jetson.
- On-device inference can improve latency, reliability, and privacy—key for robotics and IoT applications.
- Developers should assess model size and compute fit for Jetson, along with deployment workflows and optimizations.
- Open-source tooling from the ecosystem (e.g., Hugging Face) continues to reduce friction in edge AI deployments.
